Welcome to My_Workout - home training timing application.

My_Workout was created as a training project to practice my Python and MySQL skills. Idea came from              As I was travelling a lot for work I often found myself in a hotel room without an access to a gym

It uses mysqlconnector and tkiner for GUI.

App allows you to create custom timed exercises that consists of work time and break time for set number of rounds. For example: 12 rounds of boxing 3 mins of work for 1 min of break or 8 rounds for Tabata 20s work for 10s break.
